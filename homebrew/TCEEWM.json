This object counts as magical and must be no more than one size larger than the creature. Any attempt to undo the existence of the item without reducing its hit points, such as by the disintegration spell or by using it as a consumed material component for a spell, makes the effect fail and immediately ends the polymorph effect, as if the creature-object had been reduced to 0 hit points.",
