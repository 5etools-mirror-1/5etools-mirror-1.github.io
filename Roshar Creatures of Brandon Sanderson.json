					"Whitespines are dangerous crustaceans that live on Roshar. The eponymous spine is a row of spikes that runs from the head along the back of a whitespine. They are as large as horses, with a carapaced back, powerful legs, and a reptilian appearance. They have long white tusks that are used for impalement which can break off and remain lodged in their prey, causing severe damage. Whitespines have claws, including a set of vestigial claws behind their primary legs, and they smell quite unpleasant, especially when wet. They also have a nose of some sort that allows them to sniff and sneeze. They are able to enter a dormant state, most likely to hibernate, during which they appear to become coated in a thick, hard crystal-like substance that takes time to accumulate. Water washes away the crystal coating in its early stages of forming, which would make it difficult for a whitespine to undergo this metamorphosis during a highstorm.",
					"Whitespines live in packs in dens that are often strewn with the bones of the creatures they have killed. Sometimes they will live near roadways to pick off travelers as prey. They hide near the carcass of their recent kill after consuming its meat, then hunt the scavengers that are attracted to the carcass. Whitespines are native to Alethkar and possibly other areas. They are \"nastier\" than chasmfiends.",

					"The chull is a species of crustacean useful for labor intensive jobs. There are differing breeds of chulls and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They are found all across Roshar.",
					"Chulls are massive crustaceans with thick legs with large claws and a stone-like shell. Their carapaces are typically red. Chulls have whip-like antennae that grow in pace with their shell as they age, so that the chull can sense out spaces to determine if they're large enough to pass through, and beady fist-size black eyes.",
					"Chull shells are a light, porous stone created from minerals the chull consumes in its food and water and then excretes. Since the shell is not alive, chulls are not hurt when their shells are cracked or shaped. In the wild, there are often plants growing in the crevices of a chull's shell. Chulls pull their legs and head into their shell when they sleep, and as a result sleeping chulls look like large boulders or small hills.",
					"The Reshi, and likely others, paint their chulls' shells. One can identify what island a Reshi chull handler is from by the colors and patterns on their chulls' shells. Chulls are generally docile creatures. They have claws that are said to be strong enough to break a man's arm, but it is very unusual for them to behave aggressively. They tend to move with a slow, lumbering gait and are generally slower than humans.",
					"They are capable of making a wide range of noises, including a gravelly bleating, trumpeting, and snorting. Chulls are omnivorous creatures. They eat everything from rockbuds to slugs to smaller crustaceans. Domestic chulls are often fed grain. Chulls are considered less intelligent than horses and in some cases, stubborn. Chulls breed by way of laying eggs.",
					"There are several different methods of training chull.",
					"In the rural areas of Jah Keved, chulls are harnessed and controlled with complex leather bridles.",
					"In the coastal region around Kharbranth, chull drivers often sit directly on the chull's shell and direct them by tapping on their antennae with long poles.",
					"Some chulls are trained to respond to different rhythms tapped out on their shells with a guiding reed. These reeds are often as long as a person is tall and allow the driver to drive from the wagon or cart rather than riding on the chull itself.",
					"Chull are highly valued as work animals. Some people maintain chull herds and rent their labor out on a contract basis. They are slow but strong and are used to pull everything. Since their shells can be carved without harming the animal, some people sand flat places on top of a chull to ride and many carts are hooked to fittings drilled directly into their shells. Shelves and racks can also be carved into or attached directly to chull shells. Since it is lightweight and durable, chull shell is used as a crafting material. ",
					"Chull meat is edible. It can be dried and stored as jerky. In some cultures, including Herdazian and Unkalaki, chull head is considered a delicacy.",
